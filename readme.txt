For sites wanting fine-grained control over how their responses are represented in their edge cache, Pantheon Advanced Page Cache is the golden ticket. Here's a high-level overview of how the plugin works:

1. When a response is generated, the plugin uses surrogate keys to "tag" the response with identifers for the data used in the response.
2. When WordPress data is modified, the plugin triggers a purge request for the data's corresponding surrogate keys.

Because of its surrogate key technology, Pantheon Advanced Page Cache empowers WordPress sites with a significantly more accurate cache purge mechanism, and generally higher cache hit rate.

Go forth and make awesome! And, once you've built something great, [send us feature requests (or bug reports)](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-advanced-page-cache/issues).

== Installation ==

To install Pantheon Advanced Page Cache, follow these steps:

1. Install the plugin from WordPress.org using the WordPress dashboard.
2. Activate the plugin.

To install Pantheon Advanced Page Cache in one line with WP-CLI:

    wp plugin install pantheon-advanced-page-cache --activate

== Surrogate Keys ==

Surrogate keys enable responses to be "tagged" with identifiers that can then later be used in purge requests. For instance, a home page response might include the header:

    Surrogate-Key: front home post-43 user-4 post-41 post-9 post-7 post-1 user-1

Because cached responses include metadata describing the data therein, surrogate keys enable more flexible purging behavior like:

* When a post is updated, clear the cache for the post's URL, the homepage, and any index view the post appears on.
* When an author changes their name, clear the cache for the author's archive and any post they've authored.

There is a limit to the number of surrogate keys in a response, so we've optimized them based on a user's expectation of a normal WordPress site. See the "Emitted Keys" section for full details.

Use the `pantheon_wp_surrogate_keys` filter to customize surrogate keys in a response. For example, to include a surrogate key for a sidebar rendered on the homepage, you can filter the keys included in the response:

    /**
     * Add surrogate key for the featured content sidebar rendered on the homepage.
     */
    add_filter( 'pantheon_wp_surrogate_keys', function( $keys ){
	    if ( is_home() ) {
            $keys[] = 'sidebar-home-featured';
        }
        return $keys;
    });

Then, when sidebars are updated, you can use the `pantheon_wp_clear_edge_keys()` helper function to emit a purge event specific to the surrogate key:

    /**
     * Trigger a purge event for the featured content sidebar when widgets are updated.
     */
    add_action( 'update_option_sidebars_widgets', function() {
        pantheon_wp_clear_edge_keys( array( 'sidebar-home-featured' ) );
    });

Need a bit more power? Here are two additional helper functions you can use:

* `pantheon_wp_clear_edge_paths( $paths = array() )` - Purge cache for one or more paths.
* `pantheon_wp_clear_edge_all()` - Warning! With great power comes great responsibility. Purge the entire cache, but do so wisely.
